# 🛒 Ecommerce Project

This project is an eCommerce application that allows users to view a list of products, filter them by category and price, and manage a shopping cart. The product data is fetched from a JSON file.

## Features

### Product List
- ✅ Display a list of products from a JSON file.
- ✅ Filter by category: allows users to filter products by their category.
- ✅ Filter by price: allows users to filter products by their price range.

### Shopping Cart
- ✅ Add products to the cart.
- ✅ Remove products from the cart.
- ✅ Modify the quantity of products in the cart.
- ✅ Synchronize cart changes with the product list.
- ✅ Save the cart to localStorage to retain its state upon page reload (bonus points).

## Technologies Used
- ⚛️ React
- 🏗️ useContext for global state management to avoid prop drilling.
